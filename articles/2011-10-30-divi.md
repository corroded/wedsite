When I heard we were going to Divisoria to shop for some DIY stuff, my blood froze. I dreaded going there because of the tons of horror stories I heard about going there. It was a shopping warzone and we were going on a payday AND long weekend.

Call it exaggeration, cowardice or whatever, but it really sent chills down my spine.

But everything changed when we got there. There was no huge crowd, no pickpockets(well at least when we went there), and best of all, it wasn't really what I expected. Most of the stalls we went to were air-conditioned, and although we did walk a lot, it wasn't anything compared to our yearly Christmas shopping in Greenhills.

Call me lucky(since most likely, a lot of the shoppers are out on vacation), but it was a good experience nonetheless. It's not a big thing to most people especially if they regularly shop there but for a non-shopper like me, it was. I am quite happy that we got to buy a lot of things and for such cheap prices too!

Don't get me wrong, I am not looking forward to going there on a "normal" day, especially since Halloween just ended and it is almost officially the Christmas season. We'll be going back there in a couple of days and hopefully most of the shoppers are still on vacation.
